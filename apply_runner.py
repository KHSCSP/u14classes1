# make a class named Restaurant. The init method should store two attributes: a 'name' and a 'food_type' (these should be sent as parameters)
# create a method named 'describe_restaurant' that prints these two pieces of information
# create a method named 'open_restaurant' that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open

# create an instance from your class. 
# print the two attributes individually, then call both methods







# create two new instances of your Restaurant class
# use these new variables to call each method






# make a class named User

# create 2 other attributes that are typically stored in a user profile
# create a method named describe_user that prints a summary of the user's information
